Hallo Hallo, this is a chip8 emulator for the CLI, obiously designed to run mainly on linux, it is a work in progress, it currently lacks cli arguments, sound and the input is a work in progress, tough it passes all tests.
currently im working in making a tui interface with proper input handling

you can change the rom in main.rs

quirks: it has a reusable easy to understand and modular arquitecture with clear design paterns, also it's very fast and very independent to the choise of rendering and input method, made in aprox 600 lines of code
